# Angular-weather-app
## **Technologies Used**

This is my first Angular project ðŸ˜ƒ



- **ag-Grid**: To display weather data in a tabular format.
- **Highcharts**: Used for plotting temperature and humidity trend charts.
- **Bootstrap**: For styling and responsive web design.
- **RxJS**: For handling asynchronous data streams.
- **Jasmine**: For automated testing of the application's functionality.

## **Project Structure**

- **`src/app/components/weather-charts`**: Contains the **`WeatherChartsComponent`** for displaying weather charts and tabular data.
- **`src/app/components/welcome`**: Contains the **`WelcomeComponent`** which serves as the landing page of the application.
- **`src/app/services`**: Implements a service to fetch weather data.


## **Testing**

Run the automated tests with the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## **Routes**
- **`/`**: The welcome page with instructions and the option to navigate to the weather charts.
- **`/weather-charts`**: Displays the weather line charts and table.
